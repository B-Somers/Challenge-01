## Description


- Motivation for this site is to learn the basics of HTML & CSS properties while refactoring a webpage only given a pile of code that could be better optimized. 
- I built this project to improve on my fundamentals of building web pages.
- You can learn a little of the basics on SEO (search engine optimization), online reputation managment, and social media marketing.
- I learned so much doing this webpage! I had a very basic understanding of css protpeties. Now I see how they make everything come together.
